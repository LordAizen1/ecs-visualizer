📌 Top Section — Cluster Identity
Cluster-Prod

Displayed boldly as the title.

Region: us-east-1
This indicates where the cluster is deployed (AWS region).

A small X icon sits in the top-right corner — this is clearly a close button for the panel.

📊 Overview Stats Section

Labeled “Overview Stats:”
Each line has a tiny horizontal bar icon (representing metrics):

Total Tasks: 8 Running, 1 Pending

Services: 2

CPU Utilization: 65%

Memory Utilization: 48%

Active Connections: 24

This is a quick at-a-glance health summary of the entire cluster.

🧩 Services in the Cluster

This segment lists all services running inside the cluster, grouped with details.

Each service begins with a colored dot icon (yellow circle), likely indicating moderate or warning-level status.

1. web-service

Details shown:

Running: 2 tasks

Launch Type: Fargate

Tasks: task-01, task-02

(The “Running: 2 tasks” is repeated once — probably placeholder duplication in the mockup.)

This is a serverless container workload (Fargate).

2. api-gateway-service

Desired: 1 task

Running: 1 task

Launch Type: EC2

Tasks: task-03

This suggests:

It's stable (desired = running).

It runs on an EC2 instance, not Fargate.

⚠️ Security & Risks Summary

This section appears at the bottom with small triangular warning icons.

⚠️ 3 tasks with unused permissions

Indicates IAM over-privilege.

⚠️ 2 tasks with risky network flows

Maybe hitting external unencrypted endpoints, etc.

✔️ 2 tasks with risky network flows

This last line uses a green checkmark instead of a warning triangle, which likely means:

These 2 tasks had risk but are now compliant
or

It’s indicating tasks with verified risky flows (depending on the UI logic)

Symbolically:

Yellow ⚠️ = warns

Green ✔️ = confirm/detected/verified state

More context would clarify the intended semantics.
