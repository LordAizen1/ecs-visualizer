The screen is divided into two major sections:

Main data-flow visualizer (left side)

Filter sidebar (right side)

🖥️ Top Section

Hamburger menu icon

Three Info Cards

🔄 Main Data Flow Diagram

Inside a bordered box:

Central Node

A big block labeled TASK-01

Connected Nodes

Several nodes labelled D0, D1, D2, D3, D4 connected to TASK-01 via arrows.

Each arrow has a permission name written on it:

PERMISSION O

PERMISSION Y

PERMISSION Z

PERMISSION X

PERMISSION V
…something like an access graph.

Resources

Three resource boxes:

RESOURCE 1

RESOURCE 2

RESOURCE 3

Each resource also has arrows coming in from D-nodes, also annotated with permissions (like PERMISSION M, N, Y, P, K).

Basically this is a graph showing which task uses which dependency (D0–D4), through which permission, and which resources they eventually touch.
